# 🛡️ Internal Network Penetration Testing

## 📌 Introduction
**Internal Network Penetration Testing** is a security assessment performed from within an organization’s internal environment.  
It simulates insider threats or attackers who have already gained access to the internal network, aiming to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess security posture of internal systems and services.
- Identify misconfigurations, weak credentials, and unpatched systems.
- Evaluate exposure to insider threats.
- Test effectiveness of internal monitoring and defenses.
- Provide actionable remediation recommendations.

## 🔍 Methodology (Step-by-Step)
1. **Footprinting** – Identify active hosts and devices.
2. **Network Scanning** – Scan IPs, open ports, and running services.
3. **OS & Service Fingerprinting** – Detect OS and versions.
4. **Enumeration** – Extract detailed system and service information.
5. **Vulnerability Assessment** – Identify and map vulnerabilities.
6. **Exploitation** – Attempt to exploit identified weaknesses.
7. **Privilege Escalation** – Gain higher-level access on compromised systems.
8. **Post-Exploitation** – Persistence, data exfiltration, and lateral movement.
9. **Reporting** – Document findings, severity, and mitigation.

## ⚔️ Key Attack Vectors in Internal Testing
- Weak or default passwords.
- Unpatched systems and applications.
- Misconfigured network services.
- SMB, RDP, FTP, and SNMP exploitation.
- DNS poisoning and MITM attacks.
- Session hijacking and credential theft.

---

## 🧰 Tools Commonly Used
- **Nmap / Zenmap** – Network scanning & fingerprinting  
- **Wireshark** – Packet capturing & analysis  
- **Hydra / Medusa** – Password brute force attacks  
- **CrackMapExec** – Post-exploitation and lateral movement  
- **Responder** – LLMNR, NBT-NS poisoning  
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploitation and privilege escalation  
- **Mimikatz** – Credential extraction  
- **Netcat** – Remote connections and backdoors

## ✅ Best Practices for Internal Pentesting
- Define a clear scope with the client.  
- Perform in a controlled environment.  
- Maintain logs of activities.  
- Respect data sensitivity (avoid unnecessary damage).  
- Always provide remediation and defensive recommendations.  

---

## 📄 Reporting Deliverables
- Executive summary (non-technical).  
- Technical findings with proof-of-concept.  
- Risk ratings and CVSS scores.  
- Exploitation steps and screenshots.  
- Mitigation and hardening recommendations.  

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Countermeasures to Expect
- Network segmentation and VLANs.  
- IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems).  
- SIEM monitoring (Splunk, ELK).  
- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR).  
- Strong patch management and hardening policies.  
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

## 🧪 Practical Hands-On Steps
### Step-1: Footprinting  
- Identify hosts using ping sweep, ARP scan, or Nmap.

### Step-2: Network Scanning  
- Scan single IPs, multiple IPs, or entire subnets for open ports.

### Step-3: OS & Service Fingerprinting  
- Detect OS versions and services running.

### Step-4: Enumeration  
- NetBIOS, SMB, SMTP, SNMP, Telnet, HTTP enumeration.  
- Capture traffic with sniffers.  

### Step-5: Vulnerability Assessment  
- Scan with Nmap scripts, Nessus, or OpenVAS.  

### Step-6: Exploitation  
- Attempt MAC flooding, DNS poisoning, MITM, brute-forcing, etc.  

### Step-7: Post-Exploitation  
- Extract password hashes, escalate privileges, reset accounts.  
- Plant keyloggers, spyware, trojans, or backdoors.  
- Perform data exfiltration or persistence methods.  

### Step-8: Cleanup  
- Reset target to original state.  
- Remove created accounts, malware, and logs.
